# Restaurant Tips Analysis (Excel)

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting restaurant tip amounts using Excel. The dataset contains information on customer characteristics, visit timing, and bill details. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and dashboard creation to understand tipping behavior and key influencing factors.

## Objective
- Estimate tip amounts based on total bill, gender, day, smoker status, group size, and time
- Summarize insights using pivot tables and charts
- Build a regression model to identify key drivers of tips
- Present findings through a clear and interactive dashboard

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Total bill amount  
- Tip amount  
- Customer gender  
- Smoking status  
- Day of visit  
- Time of visit (Lunch/Dinner)  
- Group size  

## Data Preparation
- Removed duplicate records
- Encoded categorical variables into numeric values for regression analysis
- Applied formatting such as bold headers and borders for better readability and structure

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Created pivot tables to analyze total tips by gender  
  - Male customers contributed $485 in total tips
  - Female customers contributed $245 in total tips
- Analyzed tipping behavior by gender and meal time
  - During dinner, males tipped $390.96 and females tipped $156.11
  - During lunch, males tipped $95.11 and females tipped $88.40
- Visualized findings using pie charts and bar charts
- Performed correlation analysis
  - Total bill (0.675) and group size (0.488) show strong positive correlation with tip amount
  - Gender, smoker status, day, and time show negligible correlation with tips

## Model Building
- Built a regression model to predict tip amounts
- Model explains 46.9% of the variation in tip values
- The model is statistically significant (F = 34.72)
- Key findings:
  - Total bill is the strongest predictor (coefficient: 0.09437)
  - Group size also positively impacts tips (coefficient: 0.1739)
  - Gender, smoker status, day, and time do not significantly influence tip prediction

## Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was created to summarize insights:
- Total customers: 243
- Average total bill: $20
- Average tip: $3
- Visualizations included:
  - Pie chart: Tip contribution by gender
  - Bar chart: Tips by gender and meal time
  - Scatter plot: Predicted vs actual tips
  - Column chart: Tip totals by day

Key dashboard insights:
- Weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) generate the highest total tips
- Dinner hours contribute the majority of tips
- Male customers consistently contribute higher tip amounts

## Project Files
- Excel file containing cleaned data, analysis, regression model, and dashboard
- PDF report with detailed explanation and screenshots of outputs

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals clear patterns in customer tipping behavior. Tips are strongly influenced by spending level and group size, while timing factors such as dinner hours and weekends significantly increase tip amounts. The findings highlight that weekends and dinner periods are the most profitable times, with higher customer activity and spending.
